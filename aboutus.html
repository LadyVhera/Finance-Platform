                            <p>TPT is a platform by Mexicans for Mexicans to alleviate the level of poverty and
                                suffering in our society — a platform where we all help each other and stand in the gap
                                between Mexicans and other Mexicans. Since the government has failed to be of help and
                                assistance to the people as they should, we are not a Ponzi, pyramid, or get-rich-quick
                                scheme, or even a platform where people get robbed of their hard-earned resources.</p>

                            <p>The modern world is bad — it is inhumane, unfair, and unjust. It is a world of money. It
                                is not made for people. It is made for those who make money — the rich, bankers,
                                politicians, and the government. Ordinary people are servants for the rich, sweeping out
                                their palaces.</p>
                            <p>Many people live on the breadline, unable to maintain themselves or their families, buy
                                clothes, or afford material values. TPT creates an alternative to the current financial
                                system based on equality, sincerity, transparency, and matching rewards for every
                                effort.</p>

                        <p class="muted">Money is "shackles" into which we are put by banks and the government. You can
                            do nothing without money: neither buy
                            food, nor manage a disease. We got used to the fact that everything is done for money, and
                            we highly appreciate It. But
                            in fact, it is just pieces of paper printed by banks, with people's signatures, which are
                            backed by nothing. These
                            pieces of paper are given to people as payment for their work. The US Fed has no external
                            constraints and can print
                            dollars in unlimited quantities.
                            Central banks of other countries are regulated by the Fed.
                            Theoretically, money can be printed
                            in the amount as large as one wishes so that will suffice for everyone. But the economic
                            system is structured in such
                            a way that we sell our time, skills and knowledge for money, which is never enough.</p>

                                    TPT was first founded by James Andrade McAllister back in 2016 in company of good
                                    meaning
                                    friends and business
                                    associate, in Vietnam. Within 6 months, 20 million participants joined TPT, and the
                                    amount
                                    of "contributions" made up
                                    athird of the country's turnover. The founder of the Community wanted to go beyond
                                    Vietnam
                                    and bring TPT to other
                                    countries, but the massive success of TPT bothered the officials. The authorities
                                    wanted
                                    to take the Community over, but Mr McAllister refused to hand it over, acting in the
                                    interests of the participants.
                                    Having been denied what it had desired, the Vietnamese Government deliberately
                                    destroyed the
                                    Community and arrested Mr
                                    McAllister on false charges and confiscated the money of the participants.

                                    In 2015, James Andrade McAllister founded TPT as a multinational Community. It is
                                    the only
                                    Community in the world which
                                    has the tools to change the financial system in favor of the ordinary people.
